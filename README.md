# üß† MiniMe-MCP v0.5.0: Your IDE Agent's Persistent Brain

**Context Engineering for the Intelligence Age**

### **The Problem with Vibe Coding Today:**
- üîÑ **Endless repetition** ‚Äî "Here's how we handle auth..." (for the 50th time)
- ü§∑ **Context amnesia** ‚Äî AI forgets your patterns, preferences, and decisions
- üèùÔ∏è **Project islands** ‚Äî Learning from one project never benefits another
- üìö **Knowledge leakage** ‚Äî Insights evaporate between sessions

## Stop Explaining Yourself to Your AI

Your IDE agent forgets everything. Cursor doesn't remember your patterns. Claude Desktop starts fresh. Copilot suggests code you already rejected.

**Every session, you start from zero.**

---

## What is MiniMe-MCP?

A memory layer for your IDE agents. One system, works with **Cursor, Claude Desktop, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, VS Code**‚Äîany tool that speaks MCP.

**Your agent learns once, remembers forever, applies everywhere.**

## Installation: 

üìñ **[Complete Installation Guide](install/install.md)** - Step-by-step setup for all supported IDEs

## How It Works

### **Search Your Memories**
```
You (in Cursor): "Search my memories about authentication patterns"

Cursor: "Found 12 memories across 3 projects:
         
         payment-service-v2 (2 months ago):
         ‚Üí JWT with refresh token rotation
         ‚Üí Redis mutex prevents race conditions
         ‚Üí You debugged concurrent refresh calls for 6 hours
         
         user-api-v1 (4 months ago):
         ‚Üí Security audit: never use localStorage for tokens
         ‚Üí Team decision: httpOnly cookies only
         
         admin-dashboard (1 month ago):
         ‚Üí 15min access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
         ‚Üí Auto-refresh 2 minutes before expiry"

You: "Build auth for my checkout flow"

Cursor: [Generates code using YOUR battle-tested patterns]
```

*Works with Claude Code, Cursor and Claude Desktop and more..*

### **Get Cross-Project Insights**
```
You (in Claude Desktop): "Get insights on database patterns across my projects"

Claude: "Analyzed 89 memories across 5 projects. Pattern detected:
         
         You ALWAYS follow this progression:
         1. Start with PostgreSQL (projects: 5/5)
         2. Hit connection pool limits around 10K users (projects: 3/5)
         3. Add PgBouncer to solve it (projects: 3/3 that hit the issue)
         
         Current project: user-service-v3
         Expected scale: 50K users
         
         Recommendation: Include PgBouncer from day 1. You'll need it,
         and adding it later caused 2 hours of downtime in admin-api."
```

*Works with Claude Code, Cursor and Claude Desktop and more..*

### **Search Your Documents**
```
You (in Cursor): "Search my documents about webhook security"

Cursor: "Found in 'API Security Guidelines v2.pdf' (uploaded last week):
         
         Page 47: Webhook Signature Verification
         ‚Üí MUST use HMAC-SHA256
         ‚Üí Signature in X-Webhook-Signature header
         ‚Üí Replay attack protection: 5-minute timestamp window
         ‚Üí Rate limiting: 100 webhooks/minute per endpoint
         
         Also found related memory from payment-service-v1:
         ‚Üí You got burned by missing signature verification
         ‚Üí Production incident: fake webhook drained test account
         
         I'll implement webhooks with proper security from the start."
```

### **Search Memories AND Documents Together**
```
You (in Claude Desktop): "Search my memories and documents about 
                          error handling, include linked projects"

Claude: "Searching across:
         - Current project: ecommerce-api
         - Linked projects: payment-service-v2, order-management
         - Uploaded documents: 3 PDFs, 12 markdown files
         
         From documents:
         ‚Üí 'Engineering Standards.pdf': Error codes must follow
           ERR-{DOMAIN}-{CODE} format (e.g., ERR-AUTH-001)
         
         From payment-service-v2 memories:
         ‚Üí You built a standardized error response wrapper
         ‚Üí Includes: error code, message, trace_id, timestamp
         ‚Üí Logs to Sentry with context
         
         From order-management memories:
         ‚Üí You added retry logic with exponential backoff
         ‚Üí Max 3 retries, 2^n second delays
         
         I can implement error handling using all these patterns."
```

### **Store What Matters**
```
You (in Cursor): "Store a memory: We decided against microservices.
                  Team is too small (3 devs). Maintenance overhead
                  not worth it. Monolith with clear module boundaries
                  instead."

Cursor: "‚úì Stored as decision with high importance.
         I'll suggest monolith architecture in future projects."
```

### **Link Projects, Learn Everywhere**
```
You: "Link payment-service-v1 to checkout-api as dependency"

You: "Search my memories about Stripe webhooks, include linked projects"

Cursor: "Found context from payment-service-v1:
         
         Decision (6 months ago):
         ‚Üí Stripe webhooks need idempotency keys
         ‚Üí You discovered this after processing same payment twice
         ‚Üí Solution: Store event IDs in Redis with 24hr TTL
         
         Bug fix (3 months ago):
         ‚Üí Race condition with concurrent webhook deliveries
         ‚Üí Fixed with Redis distributed lock
         
         Applying both lessons to checkout-api implementation..."
```

### **Manage Tasks With Context**
```
You: "Create task: Fix mobile login button not responding"

Cursor: "‚úì Task created (ID: task_847)
         Want to link related memories?"

You: "Yes, link to yesterday's auth debugging session"

---

Next day:

You: "Show my tasks"

Cursor: "1 pending task:
         ‚Üí Fix mobile login button not responding
         ‚Üí Related: Auth debugging session, JWT refresh race condition
         
         Should I expand the debugging session memory?"

You: "Yes"

Cursor: "From debugging session:
         ‚Üí Issue: JWT refresh happens mid-form-submit
         ‚Üí Button disabled during API call
         ‚Üí Race condition prevents re-enable
         ‚Üí Solution discussed: Debounce + optimistic UI
         
         Ready to implement the fix?"
```

### **Upload Documents, Share Knowledge**
```
You (in Claude Desktop): [Uploads "API Documentation v3.pdf" - 10MB]

Claude: "Processing... Done in 28 seconds.
         
         Created 868 chunks from 247 pages.
         I now understand:
         ‚Üí OAuth 2.0 implementation (section 3)
         ‚Üí Rate limiting rules (section 7.2)
         ‚Üí Webhook signature verification (section 9)
         ‚Üí Database sharding strategy (section 12)
         ‚Üí Error code taxonomy (appendix B)
         
         All stored with semantic search enabled."

---

Later, in Cursor:

You: "Build the OAuth refresh token endpoint"

Cursor: [Generates code matching section 3 of your PDF exactly]
        "Implementation follows your API docs:
         ‚Üí 15-minute access tokens
         ‚Üí 7-day refresh tokens  
         ‚Üí Rotation on every refresh
         ‚Üí httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies"
```

### **Keep Memory Clean**
```
You: "Search Redis caching patterns"

Claude: "Found 47 memories from user-service-v1.
         
         But I also see newer memories showing you migrated
         to Memcached in user-service-v2 last month.
         
         Should I inactivate the old Redis memories?"

You: "Yes, inactivate them. Reason: migrated to Memcached"

Claude: "‚úì Inactivated 47 Redis memories (soft delete, recoverable)
         ‚úì Audit trail preserved
         ‚úì I'll suggest Memcached patterns by default now
         
         Your context stays current as your stack evolves."
```

## üöÄ What's New in v0.5.0

![MiniMe-MCP v0.5.0 Dashboard](images/s5.jpg)

*Works with Claude Code, Cursor and Claude Desktop and more..*

### üìö **Document Upload & RAG System**
Turn any PDF, DOCX, or code file into searchable agent knowledge.

**What you get:**
- Multi-format: PDF, DOCX, Markdown, CSV, Excel, all code files
- Lightning fast: 10MB PDF ‚Üí searchable in < 30 seconds
- Smart chunking: 1000-token chunks with 128-token overlap
- Hybrid search: Vector similarity + keyword + tag matching
- Zero API costs: YAKE keyword extraction (9s for 868 chunks)
- Upload once: Every IDE agent gets instant access

**The workflow:**
```
1. Upload docs in Claude Desktop
2. MiniMe processes, chunks, embeds, tags
3. Cursor gets the same knowledge instantly
4. Your whole team codes against one knowledge base
```

**Real impact:**
- Architecture docs ‚Üí Agent understands your system design
- API specs ‚Üí Agent generates spec-compliant code
- Security guidelines ‚Üí Agent follows your security rules
- Past project docs ‚Üí Agent learns from your history

---

### üîó **Project Linking System**
Connect projects. Share intelligence. Learn everywhere.

**Link types:**
- `dependency` - Shared libraries (auth-lib used by 5 projects)
- `parent/child` - Version iterations (v1 ‚Üí v2 ‚Üí v3)
- `fork` - Experimental branches (compare approaches)
- `template` - Starter patterns (reusable scaffolds)
- `related` - Similar domains (all payment services)

**What you get:**
- Many-to-many relationships
- Recursive search up to 5 levels deep
- Auto-detection of related projects (finds shared patterns)
- Visibility controls (full access, metadata-only, hidden)

**The power:**
```
Project graph:
auth-library-v2 (dependency)
‚îú‚îÄ Used by: ecommerce-api
‚îú‚îÄ Used by: admin-dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ Used by: mobile-backend
‚îî‚îÄ Links to: auth-library-v1 (parent)

One lesson learned ‚Üí Applied to 4 projects automatically
```

**Example use case:**
```
You: "Link payment-service-v1 as parent to payment-service-v2"
You: "Search webhook patterns, include linked projects"

Agent finds:
‚Üí Production incident from v1 (duplicate webhook processing)
‚Üí Solution that worked in v1 (Redis deduplication)
‚Üí Automatically applies lesson to v2 implementation
```

---

### üîÑ **Memory Lifecycle Management**
Your patterns evolve. Your memory should too.

**Three actions:**
- `update` - Modify content, tags, importance, type (partial updates)
- `inactivate` - Soft delete with reason (recoverable, audit trail)
- `reactivate` - Restore archived memories

**What you get:**
- Full change history with timestamps
- Reasons for every inactivation
- Prevents knowledge drift as your stack evolves
- Keeps context clean and relevant

**Example workflow:**
```
6 months ago: "We decided against Kubernetes (too complex for 3-dev team)"
Today: Team grew to 15 devs, complexity is manageable

You: "Update memory #847: We're adopting Kubernetes now.
      Team size makes the complexity worth it."

Agent: "‚úì Updated. Reason: Team growth (3 ‚Üí 15 devs)
       ‚úì Original decision preserved in audit trail
       ‚úì I'll suggest Kubernetes for new projects now"
```

---

### üåê **Global Rules System**
Set guardrails once. Every IDE agent follows them forever.

**How it works:**
- Store rules in special `__global__` project
- Rules auto-load during MCP handshake (before first user message)
- Apply to ALL projects, ALL agents, ALL time

**Priority levels:**
- üî¥ **Critical (‚â•0.8)** - Safety guardrails, must follow
- üü° **Important (‚â•0.6)** - Best practices, strong suggestions
- üü¢ **Normal (<0.6)** - Preferences, nice-to-haves

**4 default rules included in v0.5.0:**

1. üî¥ **Always Confirm Destructive Operations**  
   Ask before deleting files, dropping tables, force-pushing git, etc.

2. üî¥ **Never Implement Fallbacks Without Asking**  
   If user requests specific tool/approach, report failures, don't substitute silently

3. üî¥ **Proactively Search Memories Before Implementing** (NEW!)  
   When implementing features, auto-search for relevant context, past patterns, known issues

4. üü° **Load Rules on Initialization**  
   Call get_rules on startup to ensure consistent behavior

**Example:**
```
You (in Claude Desktop): "Store global rule: Always use TypeScript
                          strict mode. No exceptions."

---

Next week in Cursor:

Cursor: [Auto-generates TypeScript with strict: true]
        "Following global rule: TypeScript strict mode enabled."

---

Next month in Copilot:

Copilot: [Suggests JavaScript]

You: "Hey, we use TypeScript"

Copilot: "You're right! Global rule requires TypeScript strict mode.
          Switching to TypeScript with strict: true..."
```

---

### üìä **Token Usage Analytics**
Know your knowledge costs. Optimize your memory footprint.

**Dashboard shows:**
- Total tokens across all memories and documents
- Per-project breakdown with memory counts
- Memory type distribution (decisions vs code vs docs)
- Growth trends over time
- Token-efficient vs token-heavy projects

**Example view:**
```
üìä Total Tokens: 2.4M
‚îú‚îÄ Memories: 1.8M (75%)
‚îú‚îÄ Document chunks: 500K (21%)
‚îî‚îÄ Tags/metadata: 100K (4%)

üèÜ Top Projects:
1. ecommerce-api: 890K tokens
   ‚Üí 580 memories, 120 document chunks
   ‚Üí Largest: Design decisions (250K tokens)

2. payment-service: 620K tokens
   ‚Üí 340 memories, 85 document chunks
   ‚Üí Largest: API documentation (180K tokens)

üìà Trend: +15K tokens/week (healthy growth)

üí° Memory Type Distribution:
‚îú‚îÄ Decisions: 35% (critical architectural context)
‚îú‚îÄ Code snippets: 25% (reusable patterns)
‚îú‚îÄ Design docs: 20% (system understanding)
‚îî‚îÄ Working notes: 15% (session context)
```

**Why it matters:**
- Future-ready for OpenAI-compatible pricing
- Identify bloated projects needing cleanup
- Optimize what you store vs what you inactivate
- Understand where your context budget goes

## üí° Pro Tips

### **Make Your Agent Proactive**
The new **Proactive Context Retrieval** global rule makes your agent automatically search memories before implementing. It's enabled by default, but you can customize it:

```
"Store a global rule: When implementing auth, payments, or database
 features, ALWAYS search memories and documents first. Look for:
 past decisions, known bugs, security requirements, and team patterns."
```

### **Search Strategically**
```
Semantic search: "authentication patterns" (finds related concepts)
Keyword search: "Redis connection pooling" (exact matches)
File path filter: "src/auth/%" (memories touching auth files)
Linked projects: include_linked_projects: true (cross-project learning)
Search target: "all" (both memories AND documents)
```

### **Link Projects for Maximum Intelligence**
```
Best practices:
- Link v1 ‚Üí v2 as parent/child (learn from mistakes)
- Link shared libraries as dependencies (consistent patterns)
- Link experimental branches as forks (compare approaches)
- Link similar domains as related (discover patterns)
```

### **Curate Regularly**
```
Monthly memory audit:
1. Search for outdated patterns (old stack decisions)
2. Inactivate obsolete memories (with clear reasons)
3. Update evolving patterns (keep context current)
4. Tag memories well (improves future search)
```

### **Use Progressive Disclosure**
```
Efficient workflow:
1. Search returns memory IDs (fast, low-token overview)
2. Review titles and summaries (decide what's relevant)
3. Expand specific IDs (get full content only when needed)
4. Request context window if needed (¬±1 or ¬±2 surrounding chunks)
```
