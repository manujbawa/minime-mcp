*MiniMe-MCP: Supercharge your AI Agents with your memories*

*Your digital developer twin—Because "Explain Our Setup Again" Gets Old Fast*

*v0.5.39: October 2025*

## The Problem: Your AI Has Amnesia

Everyone's doing it now—**vibe coding** with AI assistants. That magical flow where you're thinking out loud, the AI gets it, and code just happens.

**But here's the catch**: Your AI forgets everything. Every conversation starts from zero. Every project feels like explaining yourself to a stranger who forgot your last 47 conversations. Enter **Context-Engineering"

- 🔄 **Endless repetition** — "Here's how we handle auth..." (for the 50th time)
- 🤷 **Context amnesia** — AI forgets your patterns, preferences, and hard-won decisions
- 🏝️ **Project islands** — Learning from one project never benefits another
- 📚 **Knowledge leakage** — That brilliant debugging insight? Gone tomorrow.

---

## The Solution: Your AI's Digital Hippocampus

**MiniMe-MCP** is the persistent memory layer your IDE agents desperately need.

Instead of this painful cycle:
```
You: "Hey AI, remember we use PostgreSQL with..."
You: "Oh, and we prefer functional components..."
You: "Also, we decided against Redis because..."
```

You get this:
```
You: "Build auth for the checkout flow"

AI:  "Using your battle-tested pattern from payment-service-v2:
      → JWT with refresh token rotation
      → httpOnly cookies (per your security audit decision)
      → Redis mutex to prevent race conditions (you debugged this for 6 hours)
      → 15min access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens

      Implementing now..."
```

**Your code. Your patterns. Your decisions. Remembered. Connected. Evolved.**

## How It Works

### 🔍 **Search Your Memories**
```
You (in Cursor): "Search my memories about authentication patterns"

Cursor: "Found 12 memories across 3 projects:

         payment-service-v2 (2 months ago):
         → JWT with refresh token rotation
         → Redis mutex prevents race conditions
         → You debugged concurrent refresh calls for 6 hours

         user-api-v1 (4 months ago):
         → Security audit: never use localStorage for tokens
         → Team decision: httpOnly cookies only

         admin-dashboard (1 month ago):
         → 15min access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
         → Auto-refresh 2 minutes before expiry"

You: "Build auth for my checkout flow"

Cursor: [Generates code using YOUR battle-tested patterns]
```

![Memory Search Interface](images/s1.jpg)

---

### 🧠 **Get Cross-Project Insights**
```
You (in Claude Desktop): "Get insights on database patterns across my projects"

Claude: "Analyzed 89 memories across 5 projects. Pattern detected:

         You ALWAYS follow this progression:
         1. Start with PostgreSQL (projects: 5/5)
         2. Hit connection pool limits around 10K users (projects: 3/5)
         3. Add PgBouncer to solve it (projects: 3/3 that hit the issue)

         Current project: user-service-v3
         Expected scale: 50K users

         Recommendation: Include PgBouncer from day 1. You'll need it,
         and adding it later caused 2 hours of downtime in admin-api."
```

---

### 📚 **Search Your Documents**
```
You (in Cursor): "Search my documents about webhook security"

Cursor: "Found in 'API Security Guidelines v2.pdf' (uploaded last week):

         Page 47: Webhook Signature Verification
         → MUST use HMAC-SHA256
         → Signature in X-Webhook-Signature header
         → Replay attack protection: 5-minute timestamp window
         → Rate limiting: 100 webhooks/minute per endpoint

         Also found related memory from payment-service-v1:
         → You got burned by missing signature verification
         → Production incident: fake webhook drained test account

         I'll implement webhooks with proper security from the start."
```

---

### 🔗 **Search Memories AND Documents Together**
```
You (in Claude Desktop): "Search my memories and documents about
                          error handling, include linked projects"

Claude: "Searching across:
         - Current project: ecommerce-api
         - Linked projects: payment-service-v2, order-management
         - Uploaded documents: 3 PDFs, 12 markdown files

         From documents:
         → 'Engineering Standards.pdf': Error codes must follow
           ERR-{DOMAIN}-{CODE} format (e.g., ERR-AUTH-001)

         From payment-service-v2 memories:
         → You built a standardized error response wrapper
         → Includes: error code, message, trace_id, timestamp
         → Logs to Sentry with context

         From order-management memories:
         → You added retry logic with exponential backoff
         → Max 3 retries, 2^n second delays

         I can implement error handling using all these patterns."
```

---

### 💾 **Store What Matters**
```
You (in Cursor): "Store a memory: We decided against microservices.
                  Team is too small (3 devs). Maintenance overhead
                  not worth it. Monolith with clear module boundaries
                  instead."

Cursor: "✓ Stored as decision with high importance.
         I'll suggest monolith architecture in future projects."
```

---

### 🔗 **Link Projects, Learn Everywhere**
```
You: "Link payment-service-v1 to checkout-api as dependency"

You: "Search my memories about Stripe webhooks, include linked projects"

Cursor: "Found context from payment-service-v1:

         Decision (6 months ago):
         → Stripe webhooks need idempotency keys
         → You discovered this after processing same payment twice
         → Solution: Store event IDs in Redis with 24hr TTL

         Bug fix (3 months ago):
         → Race condition with concurrent webhook deliveries
         → Fixed with Redis distributed lock

         Applying both lessons to checkout-api implementation..."
```

---

### ✅ **Manage Tasks With Context**
```
You: "Create task: Fix mobile login button not responding"

Cursor: "✓ Task created (ID: task_847)
         Want to link related memories?"

You: "Yes, link to yesterday's auth debugging session"

---

Next day:

You: "Show my tasks"

Cursor: "1 pending task:
         → Fix mobile login button not responding
         → Related: Auth debugging session, JWT refresh race condition

         Should I expand the debugging session memory?"

You: "Yes"

Cursor: "From debugging session:
         → Issue: JWT refresh happens mid-form-submit
         → Button disabled during API call
         → Race condition prevents re-enable
         → Solution discussed: Debounce + optimistic UI

         Ready to implement the fix?"
```

---

### 📄 **Upload Documents, Share Knowledge**
```
You (in Claude Desktop): [Uploads "API Documentation v3.pdf" - 10MB]

Claude: "Processing... Done in 28 seconds.

         Created 868 chunks from 247 pages.
         I now understand:
         → OAuth 2.0 implementation (section 3)
         → Rate limiting rules (section 7.2)
         → Webhook signature verification (section 9)
         → Database sharding strategy (section 12)
         → Error code taxonomy (appendix B)

         All stored with semantic search enabled."

---

Later, in Cursor:

You: "Build the OAuth refresh token endpoint"

Cursor: [Generates code matching section 3 of your PDF exactly]
        "Implementation follows your API docs:
         → 15-minute access tokens
         → 7-day refresh tokens
         → Rotation on every refresh
         → httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies"
```

---

### 🧹 **Keep Memory Clean**
```
You: "Search Redis caching patterns"

Claude: "Found 47 memories from user-service-v1.

         But I also see newer memories showing you migrated
         to Memcached in user-service-v2 last month.

         Should I inactivate the old Redis memories?"

You: "Yes, inactivate them. Reason: migrated to Memcached"

Claude: "✓ Inactivated 47 Redis memories (soft delete, recoverable)
         ✓ Audit trail preserved
         ✓ I'll suggest Memcached patterns by default now

         Your context stays current as your stack evolves."
```

## 🚀 What's New in v0.5.39

![MiniMe-MCP v0.5.39 Dashboard](images/s5.jpg)

### 🌐 **HTTP Transport with Streamable SSE**
Direct HTTP connections for modern IDEs—no npm client needed for most tools.

**What changed:**
- Native HTTP/SSE transport for real-time streaming
- Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code, Windsurf work out of the box
- Optional npm client for command-only IDEs (Claude Desktop, Zed, JetBrains)
- Single unified MCP endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/mcp`

---

### 📚 **Document Upload & RAG System**
Turn any PDF, DOCX, or code file into searchable agent knowledge.

**What you get:**
- Multi-format: PDF, DOCX, Markdown, CSV, Excel, all code files
- Lightning fast: 10MB PDF → searchable in < 30 seconds
- Smart chunking: 1000-token chunks with 128-token overlap
- Hybrid search: Vector similarity + keyword + tag matching
- Zero API costs: YAKE keyword extraction (9s for 868 chunks)
- Upload once: Every IDE agent gets instant access

**Real impact:**
- Architecture docs → Agent understands your system design
- API specs → Agent generates spec-compliant code
- Security guidelines → Agent follows your security rules
- Past project docs → Agent learns from your history

---

### 🔗 **Project Linking System**
Connect projects. Share intelligence. Learn everywhere.

**Link types:**
- `dependency` - Shared libraries (auth-lib used by 5 projects)
- `parent/child` - Version iterations (v1 → v2 → v3)
- `fork` - Experimental branches (compare approaches)
- `template` - Starter patterns (reusable scaffolds)
- `related` - Similar domains (all payment services)

**What you get:**
- Many-to-many relationships
- Recursive search up to 5 levels deep
- Auto-detection of related projects (finds shared patterns)
- Visibility controls (full access, metadata-only, hidden)

**The power:**
```
Project graph:
auth-library-v2 (dependency)
├─ Used by: ecommerce-api
├─ Used by: admin-dashboard
├─ Used by: mobile-backend
└─ Links to: auth-library-v1 (parent)

One lesson learned → Applied to 4 projects automatically
```

---

### 🔄 **Memory Lifecycle Management**
Your patterns evolve. Your memory should too.

**Three actions:**
- `update` - Modify content, tags, importance, type (partial updates)
- `inactivate` - Soft delete with reason (recoverable, audit trail)
- `reactivate` - Restore archived memories

**What you get:**
- Full change history with timestamps
- Reasons for every inactivation
- Prevents knowledge drift as your stack evolves
- Keeps context clean and relevant

---

### 🌐 **Global Rules System**
Set guardrails once. Every IDE agent follows them forever.

**How it works:**
- Store rules in special `__global__` project
- Rules auto-load during MCP handshake (before first user message)
- Apply to ALL projects, ALL agents, ALL time

**4 default rules included:**

1. 🔴 **Always Confirm Destructive Operations**
   Ask before deleting files, dropping tables, force-pushing git

2. 🔴 **Never Implement Fallbacks Without Asking**
   Report failures, don't substitute silently

3. 🔴 **Proactively Search Memories Before Implementing**
   Auto-search for relevant context, past patterns, known issues

4. 🟡 **Load Rules on Initialization**
   Ensure consistent behavior across all sessions

---

### 📊 **Token Usage Analytics**
Know your knowledge costs. Optimize your memory footprint.

**Dashboard shows:**
- Total tokens across all memories and documents
- Per-project breakdown with memory counts
- Memory type distribution (decisions vs code vs docs)
- Growth trends over time
- Token-efficient vs token-heavy projects

**Why it matters:**
- Future-ready for OpenAI-compatible pricing
- Identify bloated projects needing cleanup
- Optimize what you store vs what you inactivate
- Understand where your context budget goes

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Make Your Agent Proactive**
The **Proactive Context Retrieval** global rule makes your agent automatically search memories before implementing. Customize it:

```
"Store a global rule: When implementing auth, payments, or database
 features, ALWAYS search memories and documents first. Look for:
 past decisions, known bugs, security requirements, and team patterns."
```

### **Search Strategically**
```
Semantic search: "authentication patterns" (finds related concepts)
Keyword search: "Redis connection pooling" (exact matches)
File path filter: "src/auth/%" (memories touching auth files)
Linked projects: include_linked_projects: true (cross-project learning)
Search target: "all" (both memories AND documents)
```

### **Link Projects for Maximum Intelligence**
```
Best practices:
- Link v1 → v2 as parent/child (learn from mistakes)
- Link shared libraries as dependencies (consistent patterns)
- Link experimental branches as forks (compare approaches)
- Link similar domains as related (discover patterns)
```

### **Curate Regularly**
```
Monthly memory audit:
1. Search for outdated patterns (old stack decisions)
2. Inactivate obsolete memories (with clear reasons)
3. Update evolving patterns (keep context current)
4. Tag memories well (improves future search)
```

### **Use Progressive Disclosure**
```
Efficient workflow:
1. Search returns memory IDs (fast, low-token overview)
2. Review titles and summaries (decide what's relevant)
3. Expand specific IDs (get full content only when needed)
4. Request context window if needed (±1 or ±2 surrounding chunks)
```
