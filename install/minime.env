# Processing Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Process memories immediately when added vs queuing for batch processing
# Used by: unified-insights-service.js, v2-async-processor.js

# false: Queue memories for later batch processing (better for bulk imports)
# Ollama Recommendation: true (local models respond quickly, no rate limits)
REAL_TIME_PROCESSING=true

# Number of memories to process together in a single batch
# Used by: v2-async-processor.js, clustering-processor-v2.js
# Impact: Lower (5-10) = less memory usage, more API calls
#         Higher (20-50) = more memory usage, fewer API calls, faster overall
# Note: Different from SUB_CLUSTER_BATCH_SIZE which controls sub-cluster processing
# Ollama Recommendation: 5-10 (smaller batches work better with single-threaded processing)
BATCH_SIZE=10

# Maximum parallel operations (embeddings, clustering, insights)
# Used by: v2-async-processor.js, unified-insights-service.js
# Examples: 5 memories embedded at once, 5 clusters analyzed in parallel
# Tuning: Increase for cloud APIs (10-20), decrease for local models (2-5)
# Ollama Recommendation: 2-3 (Ollama handles one request at a time, too many parallel = queue buildup)
MAX_CONCURRENT=3

# Enable background job queue for non-blocking processing
# Used by: unified-insights-service.js, service-initializer.js

# Document Upload & Embedding Configuration
# ============================================================================

# Document chunk size in characters (deprecated - use CHUNK_SIZE_TOKENS instead)
# Used by: chunking-service.js (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)
# Impact: Controls maximum size of document chunks for embedding
# Formula: chars / 3.5 ≈ tokens (approximate, varies by tokenizer)
# Constraint: Must stay under embedding model's context window (512 tokens for mxbai-embed-large)
# Recommendations:
#   1500 chars (~430 tokens): Safe for BERT-based models with 512-token limit (recommended)
#   1750 chars (~500 tokens): Tighter margin, may fail on special characters
#   3500 chars (~1000 tokens): Requires models with larger context windows
# Note: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter respects semantic boundaries (paragraphs/sentences)
# Default: 1500 (safe for mxbai-embed-large with safety margin for tokenization differences)
CHUNK_SIZE_CHARS=1500

# Document chunk size in TOKENS (RECOMMENDED - uses BERT tokenizer for accuracy)
# Used by: chunking-service.js with BERT token counting
# Impact: Controls maximum tokens per chunk using exact BERT tokenization
# Constraint: MUST NOT exceed embedding model's context window
# mxbai-embed-large limit: 512 tokens (PARAMETER num_ctx 512)
# Recommendations:
#   500 tokens: Safe with margin for model limit (recommended)
#   512 tokens: Maximum for mxbai-embed-large
# CRITICAL: Setting this higher than 512 will cause embedding failures!
CHUNK_SIZE_TOKENS=500

# Document chunk overlap in characters (deprecated - use CHUNK_OVERLAP_TOKENS instead)
# Used by: chunking-service.js (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)
# Impact: How much context is shared between adjacent chunks

# Recommendations:
#   10-15% of CHUNK_SIZE_CHARS: Good balance (175 chars for 1500, 200 chars for 1750)
#   Higher overlap: Better context but more redundancy and storage
#   Lower overlap: Less redundancy but risk of losing context
# Default: 175 (11.6% overlap, good for maintaining context)
CHUNK_OVERLAP_CHARS=175

# Document chunk overlap in TOKENS (RECOMMENDED)
# Used by: chunking-service.js with BERT token counting
# Impact: How many tokens overlap between adjacent chunks

# 5+: Very persistent (good for unstable connections)
EMBEDDING_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Base delay in milliseconds for exponential backoff retries
# Used by: document-service.js (generateEmbeddingWithRetry)
# Impact: Wait time between retry attempts (doubles each retry)
# Formula: delay = baseDelay * 2^(attempt-1)
# Examples with 1000ms:
#   Retry 1: 1 second
#   Retry 2: 2 seconds
